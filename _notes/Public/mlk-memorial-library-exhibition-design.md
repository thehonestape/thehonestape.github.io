In early 2019, Workhorse began designing the permanent exhibition for the Martin Luther King Jr. Memorial Library, Washington D.C.â€™s central library. 

The permanent exhibition Up from the People: Protest and Change in DC is part of a decades-long renovation completed in 2020 by Mecanoo and OTJ Architects.
