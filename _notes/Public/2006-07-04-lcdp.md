La Clínica del Pueblo is a non-profit clinic located in Washington DC that provides health services to the DC community. It was founded in 1983 to serve many of the Salvadoran and Guatemalan refugees escaping war in their home countries. As the clinic grew, it’s work expanded into HIV/AIDS awareness and prevention, mental health services, and translation services.

Some projects I completed include creating all of the collateral for their annual gala, working with a team of developers to launch a new website, helping with website maintenance, creating their newsletters and annual reports.

Many of the colors and shapes I use for La Clínica have been inspired by Central American folk art as well as the work of Alexander Girard, whose work was also largely inspired by folk art.
