Framed within the Cereplast-Make Your Mark Contest, we were asked to create a mark for bioplastics. A bioplastic is a plastic that is made out of biomass, as opposed to being made out of fossil-fuels. My approach was to create a modular mark that would let the audience know that a product was made out of bioplastic and whether to compost or recycle.
