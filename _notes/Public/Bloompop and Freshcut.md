I worked with the founders of Bloompop to help them launch "The Etsy for Florists". <strong>I established a design system from zero and worked with the technical founder to design a custom e-commerce platform</strong>. As an early advocate for "designing in the browser", I worked with the founder to develop a workflow that involved rapid iteration. We abandoned typical design tools, and I worked directly with a whiteboard, Node.js, and Git. 

I continued to work with the Bloompop post-launch on marketing and campaign creative direction and later to extend the brand architecture to include a new product called "Freshcut" that assisted  florists in sourcing flowers directly from growers.
